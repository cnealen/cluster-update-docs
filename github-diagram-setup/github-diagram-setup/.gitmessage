# Examples:
#
# feat: add validation step before container build
#
# The cluster was experiencing crashes when multiple containers
# were built simultaneously. Added a validation step that checks
# for active builds before proceeding.
#
# Relates to issue #42
#
# --------------------
#
# fix: correct arrow alignment between steps 7 and 8
#
# The arrow was pointing to the wrong Y coordinate, making the
# flow diagram confusing. Updated the path coordinates to align
# with the center of step 8.
#
# --------------------
#
# docs: update command list with new Singularity syntax
#
# Singularity v3.8 changed the build command syntax. Updated
# the commands in the side panel to reflect current best practices.
